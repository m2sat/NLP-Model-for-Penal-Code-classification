# ðŸš¨ IPC Section Classifier for Indian Cyber Crime Reports ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³

An NLP-based text classification system that predicts relevant **Indian Penal Code (IPC)** sections from user-submitted cybercrime complaints. Developed as part of the **Smart India Hackathon (SIH)** using real-world datasets provided by government authorities.

## ðŸ§  Objective

Enable automated tagging of IPC sections based on the narrative of cybercrime complaints submitted to the **Indian Cyber Crime Portal**. This tool can assist law enforcement in faster triage and legal categorization.

## ðŸ“Œ Example

**Input:**  
"He created a fake Instagram profile with my photos and sent obscene messages to my friends."

**Predicted Output:**  
- `IPC Section 354D â€“ Cyberstalking`  
- `IPC Section 509 â€“ Word or gesture intended to insult modesty of a woman`  
- `IT Act Section 66E â€“ Violation of privacy`

## âœ… Project Highlights

- Developed during **Smart India Hackathon (SIH)** using official government-provided dataset.
- Multi-label classification pipeline trained on anonymized complaint text.
- Outputs relevant IPC and IT Act sections with confidence scores.
